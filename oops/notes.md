## javascript and classes 

Yes, JavaScript supports classes, which were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). Classes in JavaScript provide a way to create objects using a more structured and readable syntax, similar to class-based object-oriented languages like Java or C++.

While JavaScript has always been prototype-based, the class syntax is essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. This makes it easier to define and work with objects and their methods.
